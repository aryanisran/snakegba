A simple Snake Game project I created to learn game development without an engine and to learn development for the Game Boy Advance.
I set up my development environment with [this](https://github.com/JamieDStewart/GBA_VSCode_Basic) template and tutorial and I learnt to develop the game with the [TONC](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm) tutorial and library.
The downloadable ROM for this project can be found [here](https://asdeph.itch.io/snake-gba).
